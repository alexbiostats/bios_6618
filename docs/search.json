To view other questions, you can view the BIOS 6618 Recitation collection page or use the search bar to look for keywords.\n\nVariance of Estimators\nFirst, let’s start by defining some nuanced statistical terminology for an estimand, estimator, and estimate:\n\nEstimand: a precise description of what is measured, it reflects the population-level (e.g., the average weight of all dogs)\nEstimator: a method of analysis (e.g., formula, algorithm) to compute an estimate of the estimand using observed data (e.g., the sample mean is \\(\\bar{X}= \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i}{n}\\), adding the weights of all \\(n\\) dogs in our sample and dividing by the sample size \\(n\\))\nEstimate: the numeric value obtained when an estimator is applied to the observed data (e.g., the sample mean may be 21.2 kg)\n\nA humorous way to remember this might be (from Richard McElreath on Twitter):\n\n\n\nMeme of estimand, estimator, and estimate\n\n\nTo estimate the population mean, \\(\\mu\\), we can use the estimator of the sample mean, \\(\\bar{X}\\). We may be interested in identifying its sampling distribution for use in statistical inference (e.g., the summarize through an estimate, and potentially to compare between groups, calculate p-values, etc.). We know that based on the central limit theorem, for any distribution with a known mean and variance, \\(\\bar{X} \\sim N(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n})\\)).\nHowever, we can note that within our sampling distribution, we have the population-level estimate of the variance, \\(\\sigma^2\\). In some cases, we may assume this variance is “known” (e.g., a \\(Z\\)-test), but in practice we often do not have enough data or confidence in past studies to make this strong assumption. Instead, we can use \\(s^2\\) as our estimator. In our slides, we note that the unbiased estimator for the sample variance is \\(s^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i-\\bar{X})^2}{n-1}\\).\nGiven that \\(s^2\\) is an estimator, we can also work to derive the distribution of the sample variance. Here we have to make a few more assumptions than with \\(\\bar{X}\\) (since we don’t have a CLT for variances). If we assume \\(X_1,X_2,...,X_{n} \\overset{iid}{\\sim} N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\), then we can show \\(\\frac{(n-1) s^2}{\\sigma^2} \\sim \\chi^2_{n-1}\\). This allows us to further estimate the variance of our sample variance to be \\(V(s^2) = \\frac{2 \\sigma^4}{n-1}\\) (in practice, replacing \\(\\sigma^4\\) with \\(s^4\\)).\nThis variance of the sample variance can be helpful to understand the reasonable range of variance values we may expect from the population for (1) observing another random sample of \\(n\\) or (2) if we could observe the entire population. In practice, we often do not look at the variance of the sample variance because we are most interested in the sample mean. We also know some general properties (e.g., larger sample sizes will be more consistent).\n\n\nConsistency and Bias\nBias is a property of the expected value of a parameter of interest. For example, if our estimate \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is unbiased, then \\(E(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\theta\\). For any given estimator (i.e., our equation/algorithm) we can estimate the bias to be \\(\\text{Bias}(\\hat{\\theta}) = E(\\hat{\\theta}) - \\theta\\). This is really only possible in simulation studies where we can set the truth for \\(\\theta\\).\nConsistency relates to the sample size of your sample. It states that as you have more and more data, our estimate should converge in probability to the estimand/truth: \\(\\hat{\\theta}_{n} \\overset{p}{\\rightarrow} \\theta\\), where \\(n\\) is the sample size going to infinity.\nIt is possible to have situations where you have both, only one, or neither of these properties (although I’d argue some are strange settings). Let’s consider estimating the sample mean for a random sample of \\(X_1,X_2,...,X_n\\):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnbiased?\nConsistent?\nExample Estimator\n\n\n\n\nYes\nYes\n\\(\\bar{X}\\)\n\n\nYes\nNo\n\\(X_{1}\\)\n\n\nNo\nYes\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{X_i}{n} + \\frac{1}{n}\\)\n\n\nNo\nNo\n\\(\\frac{1}{X_1^3}\\)\n\n\n\nFor bias, we could estimate the theoretical properties given our assumptions (e.g., \\(E(\\bar{X})=\\mu\\), \\(E(X_1)=\\mu\\), \\(E(\\bar{X} + \\frac{1}{n})=\\mu+\\frac{1}{n}\\) (although this will be asymptotically unbiased), \\(E(\\frac{1}{X_1^3}) =\\) not trivial and we ignore here, but it isn’t \\(\\mu\\)). Let’s explore some plots of these estimators by simulating across a range of sample sizes for \\(N(\\mu=10,\\sigma=5)\\) distribution for consistency:\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(515) # set seed for reproducibility\nnsim &lt;- 1:100 # sample sizes to explore\nmy_dat &lt;- data.frame( n=nsim, yy=NA, yn=NA, ny=NA, nn=NA) # create data frame to save simulation results in for each unbiased/consistent combination\n\nfor( i in 1:length(nsim) ){\n  n &lt;- nsim[i]\n  simdat &lt;- rnorm(n=nsim, mean=10, sd=5)\n  my_dat$yy[i] &lt;- mean(simdat)\n  my_dat$yn[i] &lt;- simdat[1]\n  my_dat$ny[i] &lt;- mean(simdat) + 1/n\n  my_dat$nn[i] &lt;- 1/(simdat[1]^3)\n}\n\npar(mfrow=c(2,2)) # create panel figure\nplot(x=nsim, y=my_dat$yy, type='l', ylim=c(-10, 30), main='Unbiased, Consistent'); abline(h=10, col='blue')\nplot(x=nsim, y=my_dat$yn, type='l', ylim=c(-10, 30), main='Unbiased, Not Consistent'); abline(h=10, col='blue')\nplot(x=nsim, y=my_dat$ny, type='l', ylim=c(-10, 30), main='Biased, Consistent'); abline(h=10, col='blue')\nplot(x=nsim, y=my_dat$nn, type='l', ylim=c(-10, 30), main='Biased, Not Consistent'); abline(h=10, col='blue')\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom these plots, we can see that the non-consistent examples never converge to the true parameter value of \\(\\mu=10\\)."

    "text": "Description\nStatistical thinking can help you become a critical consumer of information while challenging you to examine the world in new ways. Advanced Biostatistical Methods I (BIOS 6618) is the first of a two-semester applied statistics sequence designed to equip students with a practical knowledge of the quantitative methods most frequently used in medical research. This course is an introduction to applied biostatistics, including probability models, simulation, sampling distributions, hypothesis testing, resampling methods, linear regression and the use of the R and SAS statistical packages. Concepts will be illustrated using examples in the fields of medicine, biology, epidemiology and public health. Written and graphical presentation and interpretation of methods and results will be emphasized.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nDifferential and integral calculus is a prerequisite for the course, along with an introductory course in applied probability and statistics. Previous experience with a statistical package (e.g. R, SAS, Stata, SPSS) is also assumed. Matrix/linear algebra will also be introduced and past coursework or experience is beneficial.\n\n\nLecture Videos, Slides, and Other Materials\nAll BIOS 6618 lecture videos have been broken down into modular sections and posted to YouTube. To view the list of videos, download slides, and access other materials, please visit the BIOS 6618 Materials page.\n\n\nJournal of BIOS 6618\nThe Journal of BIOS 6618 is the official publication for Advanced Biostatistical Methods I. It has two annual issues relating to simulation studies and applied data analysis. To learn more about the journal’s requirements for submission, please visit the the Guide for Authors page."

The questions are broadly broken down by theme with links provided to download materials or view the videos, but you may also use the Quarto search feature to try and find relevant pages throughout the course website. Responses often reinforce the content from lecture slides or extend the material to advanced topics. When possible, case studies or simulation studies are used to assist in answering the questions."
