    "text": "The Journal of BIOS 6618 is the official internal publication of the Advanced Biostatistical Methods I course at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. Each year (volume) of the journal encompasses two distinct issues: one focusing on simulation studies and another on applied data analysis. Specific details as to project deadlines, rubrics, and more can be found for current students on the Canvas course page. The details below are meant to mimic those of real journal websites for submission to provide practice for future submissions.\n\n\nTwo types of articles are accepted:\n\nSimulation studies: these articles focus on the use of simulation studies to explore research questions that do not involve “real” data. Articles may include exploration of theorems discussed in class, evaluation of test properties under various assumptions, illustration of power calculations for unique problems, or other applications where simulation studies may be of interest.\nBrief reports: these articles are short analyses to answer a research question from real world data. Articles must include at least one advanced topic including:\n\n\nBootstrap resampling\nPermutation test\nQuantile regression\nSegmented regression\nBayesian regression\nNon-linear models (e.g., using polynomial terms, splines, etc.)\nOther advanced topic (discuss with Alex for approval)"

Advanced Biostatistical Methods I (BIOS 6618) is the first of a two-semester applied statistics sequence designed to equip students with a practical knowledge of the quantitative methods most frequently used in medical research. This course is an introduction to applied biostatistics, including probability models, simulation, sampling distributions, hypothesis testing, resampling methods, linear regression and the use of the R and SAS statistical packages. Concepts will be illustrated using examples in the fields of medicine, biology, epidemiology and public health. Written and graphical presentation and interpretation of methods and results will be emphasized.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nDifferential and integral calculus is a prerequisite for the course, along with an introductory course in applied probability and statistics. Previous experience with a statistical package (e.g. R, SAS, Stata, SPSS) is also assumed. Matrix/linear algebra will also be introduced and past coursework or experience is beneficial.\n\n\nLecture Videos, Slides, and Other Materials\nAll BIOS 6618 lecture videos have been broken down into modular sections and posted to YouTube. To view the list of videos, download slides, and access other materials, please visit the BIOS 6618 Materials page.\n\n\nJournal of BIOS 6618\nThe Journal of BIOS 6618 is the official publication for Advanced Biostatistical Methods I. It has two annual issues relating to simulation studies and applied data analysis. To learn more about the journal’s requirements for submission, please visit the the Guide for Authors page."
