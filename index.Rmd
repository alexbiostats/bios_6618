### Description

Statistical thinking can help you become a critical consumer of information while challenging you to examine the world in new ways. Advanced Biostatistical Methods I (BIOS 6618) is the first of a two-semester applied statistics sequence designed to equip students with a practical knowledge of the quantitative methods most frequently used in medical research. This course is an introduction to applied biostatistics, including probability models, simulation, sampling distributions, hypothesis testing, resampling methods, linear regression and the use of the R and SAS statistical packages. Concepts will be illustrated using examples in the fields of medicine, biology, epidemiology and public health. Written and graphical presentation and interpretation of methods and results will be emphasized.


### Prerequisites

Differential and integral calculus is a prerequisite for the course, along with an introductory course in applied probability and statistics. Previous experience with a statistical package (e.g. R, SAS, Stata, SPSS) is also assumed. Matrix/linear algebra will also be introduced and past coursework or experience is beneficial.
