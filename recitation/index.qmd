This page includes the responses to various recitation requests submitted over various semesters of teaching BIOS 6618. These topics were covered during Thursday classes, so each request below may appear to come out of left field but related to topics worked on by students during the semester. The questions are broadly broken down by theme, but you may also use the Quarto search feature to try and find relevant pages throughout the course website. Responses often reinforce the content from [lecture slides](../bios_6618_materials/index.qmd) or extend the material to advanced topics. When possible, case studies or simulation studies are used to assist in answering the questions. There is also a page with BIOS 6618 class labs and practice problems (with solutions) on our [BIOS 6618 labs page](../labs/index.qmd) that provides additional examples corresponding to each week's material.
